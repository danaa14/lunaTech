            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Luna Tech is more than a tech company — it’s a laboratory of innovation.
We create products that fuse performance with intelligent design, turning everyday moments into smarter, faster, and more connected experiences.
From ultra-thin laptops to smart accessories, every Luna Tech device is built around one mission: technology should work for you, not the other way around.
We believe in precision, efficiency, and constant evolution. Here, every detail matters, every pixel has a purpose, and every idea becomes reality.</p>
